/**
 * <p>A pin in libbulldog is solely a management container. It contains
 * features that can be activated on it.</p>
 *
 * <p>E.g. one might choose to use the Pin as a {@code DigitalOutput} or a
 * {@code DigitalInput}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The pin contains the necessary information to be set up according
 * to the user's wishes. If the information of this class is not enough,
 * then board implementations derive from it. It ensures that only one
 * feature can be activated at a time. If asynchronous or blocking operations
 * are currently in progress on another feature, then the pin will deny any 
 * other feature activation during that time.</p>
 *
 * <p>Mostly, the pin is just used to grab a feature that is available on 
 * it:<br/>
 * {@code DigitalOutput output = pin.as(DigitalOutput.class);}<br/>
 * {@code Pwm pwm = pin.as(Pwm.class); }
 * </p>
